### Setting up your database
We use MySQL for the database. You need to set one up to be able to run the bot.

- Create a database file called `json.db`
- It is recommended to create a specific user for Nebula only. See [the docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/creating-accounts.html) for more information

### Setting up .env
- Copy the `example.env` file and replace the content with your own credentials inside a file called `.env`.
